This repository contains the code for the first version of the Climacs
text editor.  We are working on replacing this version of Climacs by
the second version, called Second Climacs.  However, this version is
still usable, but not perfect in that it does have defects.

There are several reasons why we are working on Second Climacs to
replace this one:

  * The representation of the buffer is not so well adapted to
    features such as incremental parsing.

  * The Common Lisp parser, while better than that of Emacs, is still
    not good enough, and totally non-maintainable.  We think we know
    how to make a better one.

  * Climacs is intimately tied to McCLIM.  We would like to isolate
    the GUI from the rest of the code so as to make it easier to
    create different GUIs.

  * We want to improve the entire infrastructure for incremental
    parsing of the buffer contents.

  * etc.

For the original README text, see the file ORIGINAL-README.

This repository does not necessarily reflect that latest state of the
old CVS repository.  We have attempted to improve the file hierarchy
and clean up the code.
